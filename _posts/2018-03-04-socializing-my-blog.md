There have been a few changes in this blog:

- Now has [an atom feed](/feed.xml).  Thanks to John Levon for the nudge and the
  [Jekyll Feed Plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed) for the
  simplicity.
- Comments as github issues.  Thanks to
  [Ivan Zuzak](http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html)
  and [Michael Koohafkan](http://hydroecology.net/using-github-to-host-blog-comments/).
- Prefer to tweet?  We got that too!  Check out the recent mentions on the
  right-hand side and add your own. Sadly, the *View on Twitter* button seems to
  be useless.
