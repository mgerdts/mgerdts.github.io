While doing zones development work, I've run into times when a zone may be in the "configured" state, yet datasets are allocated for the zone.  In the event that you see this in the wild, here's how you can force the uninstall process to run on a zone in such a state:

<pre>
# zoneadm -z z1 uninstall
zoneadm: zone 'z1': is already in state 'configured'.
# zoneadm -z z1 mark incomplete
# zoneadm -z z1 uninstall -F
</pre>
